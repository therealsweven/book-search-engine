## Description
This is a project converting a RESTful google books search API to use GraphQL and Apollo Server in a React application. The site allows the user to parse books and save them to their profile. With the user log in, you can then view your saved books gallery style. There is also functionality so that you can remove books from your profile as well.
## Installation
-npm i, npm run develop<br>
Used [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) to run the script/server
## Usage
Here is a link to the deployed application, be sure to sign up and search for books, save the results that you want by clicking the save button. Otherwise if using the source, once you have the application running you can view it using localhost:3000, and make GraphQL queries by navigating to localhost:3001/graphql.

Here is a screenshot of the application.
